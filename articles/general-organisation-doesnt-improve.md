This is a full rebuttle to [Your organization probably doesn't want to improve things](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/) written by mataroa.

> I have never met a single manager at any large company that has not said they want to be data driven.

Agreed

> I have also never seen a single one of them take any steps that could actually move them in this direction.

Disagree

> Nonetheless, the average annual salary for a Power BI developer places them in the 90th percentile of my country's annual income. For those of you unfamiliar with Power BI, you connect it to data sources and then it makes visualizations for managers to gawk at, and it is so simple to use that it is not inconceivable to me that you could actually train a monkey to make a bar chart with the correct application of positive reinforcement and peanuts.

Yes, very frustrating.

> My current organization has 8000 staff members, and I used to glance over the usage metrics of the dashboards my old team produced. I believe three dashboards were used, out of somewhere around 50 - 100. 

This sounds more like an integration problem. The dashboards don't do what people want or need.

> Management has no choice but to say that they want to be data driven. It's not like they can just come out and say that it's all fucked - so they say the only thing that is available. 

That is somewhat true.

> We are going through a "digital transformation", and that is why all of these efforts don't generate any revenue and drive staff to misery. It will be better once this current initiative successfully completes, even though we have never demonstrated the ability to successfully complete a similar initiative at any point in the past.

Which again is ok, as long as it increases efficiencies.

> 90% of everything is crud, and that explains almost everything

Not sure

> Most managers have never had an independent thought on how to manage people effectively (hence the Agile parroting),

...

> most programmers don't know what an abstraction is

...

> This is the overwhelming factor even though it isn't a satisfying answer, but it has done more for my own peace of mind than anything that follows.

> I have no idea what possesses us to turn up at work and think that we can accomplish anything with fucking Derek over there calling the shots while slamming their empty head onto a keyboard as rapidly as Jira will allow him to create cards we won't finish, but for some reason it's a thing that happens.

This makes me laugh.
